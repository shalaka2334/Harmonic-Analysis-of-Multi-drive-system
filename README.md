# Harmonic-Analysis-of-Multi-drive-system
Power Quality and Harmonic Analysis of Multi drive System in Unbalanced Load Conditions in 0-2kHz
This is my Masters level thesis which was granted to Shalaka S. Sitre at Brisbane in the year 2021.
A thesis submitted for the degree of Masters of Engineering at The University of Queensland in 2021
School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.


The thesis focuses on Harmonic Analysis for the various mitigation techniques for the Multidrive system under test. This thesis specifically lays focus on passive harmonic mitigation techniques for harmonic mitigation. Various cases of passive filters are considered for harmonic analysis evaluation. MATLAB is used for the simulation of the test cases for analysis of the harmonic performance. The aim of the thesis is to analyse permutations and combinations of passive filters so as to satisfy the IEC Regulations. Post processing of the data is done after simulations of the designs for comparison of the various cases. Various parameters are analysed with respect to the total harmonic distortion like grid impedance, choke values and specific harmonics, analysis of the various parameters and its effects on the harmonic performance. Experimental verification is done on Simulink MATLAB software.
Furthermore, Linear progression is used to analyse and forecast the Total Harmonic Distortion of the Multi-drive System. Forecasting of the harmonic performance can be cost saving in terms of hardware and complications related. Further studies can be done on Linear regression and modelling of the cases for active filter and its performance.
